/**
 * Bundles the captcha worker entry into a self-contained ESM file for
 * embedding as a `with { type: "file" }` asset in the compiled single-file
 * binary. Raw .ts assets are NOT parsed by Bun at extraction (they'd be
 * evaluated as plain JS and fail on type annotations), so the worker must
 * be pre-bundled to plain JS.
 *
 * Run before `bun build --compile` (every build:* script chains it):
 *   bun run scripts/build-fork-worker.ts
 * Output: src/proxy/captcha-worker-entry.bundle.js (gitignored build input)
